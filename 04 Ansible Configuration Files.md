# Ansible Files
With Ansible you can work in three different contexts.
This depends on where you place your Ansible configuration.

To check which config file is used, you can ask `ansible


## Project (project_folder/ansible.cfg)
## User ($HOME/.ansible.cfg)
## System (/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg)


#### Ansible Config File

#### inventory
