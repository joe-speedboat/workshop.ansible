# Protect sensible variables
You can imagine that some of the variables may need some protection.
There is a built-in mechanic to protect variable called <code>ansible-vault<code>
You can use it in two ways by default
## ansible-vault
With ansible-vault we can create symetric encrypted files ansible can work with.

## Setup Vault Project
```bash
PNAME="AnsibleVault"
PDIR="/etc/ansible/projects/vault_demo"
mkdir -p $PDIR
chmod 700 $PDIR
mkdir 
```
