## History of Ansible
* Ansible was written by Michael DeHaan in 20212
* Acquired by Red Hat in 2015

## Design
* **Minimal in nature**
Management systems should not impose additional dependencies on the environment.

* **Consistent**
With Ansible one should be able to create consistent environments.

* **Secure**
Ansible does not deploy agents to nodes. 
Only OpenSSH and Python are required on the managed nodes.
Windows systems use WinRM ans PowerShell.

* **Highly Reliable**
When carefully written, an Ansible playbook can be idempotent, to prevent unexpected sideeffects on the managed systems.
It is entirely possible to have a poorly written playbook that is not idempotent.
	* Idempotent
On/Off buttons of a train's destination sign control panel. Pressing the On button (green) is an idempotent operation, since it has the same effect whether done once or multiple times. Likewise, pressing Off is idempotent.

* **Minimal learning required**
Playbooks use an easy and descriptive language based on YAML and Jinja templates.
