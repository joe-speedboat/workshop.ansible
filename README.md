# Welcome
This is an ansible workshop I wrote for a one-day Ansible "KickStart" sesstion.
Due my past work and great community content, I got some great exaples.

It covers not even 10% of what to know about Ansible, but it will help you to start with.

The target is, that you can start using Ansible after one day.

Cheers
Chris
