# Welcome
This is an Ansible workshop I wrote for a one-day Ansible "KickStart" session.
Due my past work and great community content, I got some useful examples to show.

It covers not even 10% of what to know about Ansible, but it will help you to start with.

The target is, that you can start using Ansible after one day.

Cheers
Chris
