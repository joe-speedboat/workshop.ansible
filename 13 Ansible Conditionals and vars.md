# Ansible Conditionals and vars
Since Ansible is able to use facs and vars, we do a short review of how you can use that withing your playbooks and roles.

Here you can find a brief overview about conditions you can use out of the box
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_conditionals.html

For that we use a project we created before:
```bash
cd /etc/ansible/projects/demo_role
```
* <code>install_install_upgrade_nginx.yml</code>
```yaml
